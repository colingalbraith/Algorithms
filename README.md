# Algorithm Visualizations

This repository contains several **Python**-based visualizations for popular algorithms and data structures, including:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Sorting algorithms** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Stack and Queue** operations
- **Stable Marriage Problem** (Gale–Shapley Algorithm)

## Contents

1. **DFS&BFS.py**  
   - Visualizes **Depth-First Search** and **Breadth-First Search** on a graph or grid. See how nodes are explored step by step.

2. **sort.py**  
   - Demonstrates several sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, etc.) in real time.

3. **Stack&Que.py**  
   - An interactive **Stack and Queue** demo. Push/pop or enqueue/dequeue elements and watch the operations happen live.

4. **Stable_Marriage_Visualization.py**  
   - Animates the **Stable Marriage Problem** using the Gale–Shapley algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Algorithm-Visualizations.git
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username or the actual repo location.

Install dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Required libraries may include tkinter, matplotlib, or others. If this repo has a requirements.txt, install them with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If not, you can manually install any necessary libraries.

Run the scripts
Pick an algorithm you want to visualize:
python DFS&BFS.py

or
python sort.py

Interact with the GUI
Each script opens an interactive window. Use the provided buttons (e.g., Start, Stop, Randomize, Push, Pop) to control how the algorithm runs.
